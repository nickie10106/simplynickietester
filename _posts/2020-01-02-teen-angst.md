Pour a litre of finding yourself, a teaspoon of friendship or home drama, some societal pressure in while adding the cherry that is puberty on top and you will get the ingredients to a typical teenager’s day. Mix them all up and you get a visual representation of most thirteen to nineteen year-olds’ inner psyche – a mess.

**Teen Angst**
Teenage years are often one of the most confusing years in an individual’s life so it is no wonder that emotions and feelings are likely to manifest strongly during this time, resulting in teen angst.  According to the oxford dictionary, the angst can be defined as  “a feeling of anxiety about your life or situation”. The late psychologist William G. Perry, a Harvard professor who studied teenage behaviour, theorised that adolescence is the time at which most will start to question previous beliefs and authority figures. This, coupled with hormonal changes and expectations places on them, is what causes teenagers to develop teen angst. However, his study also draws the line between teen angst and depression, a mental illness that has recently become synonymous with teen angst due to the similarities.

**Teen Angst Vs Depression: The Difference**
While teen angst is a very real phenomenon amongst teens, clinical depression is much more severe. It is a mood disorder that can only be diagnosed by a psychiatrist and, in most cases, has to be constantly treated with medication. This is because the intensity of clinical depression is not due to everyday stress but from the lack of a chemical known as serotonin (also known as the “happy” chemical) in an individual’s brain. The lack of this chemical may be due to high stress or trauma but there is no real relation between the two.

On a surface level, it may seem like the two are separate entities but, with the rise in self-diagnosis and social media, the lines have become blurred to the public. In a poll with over a hundred respondents, it is recorded that 88% of respondents felt like they knew the difference between depression and teen angst. However when given scenarios and asked to identify which was teen angst or depression, 67% answered with unsure.

When asked about how the line between the two has begun to blur, many blame social media and trends. “I think it’s just one of those things. Some people they want to join the band wagon. Being ‘depressed’ seems edgy and cool so they think ‘oh I could do that too’.” Mabel Lin, 21, who has been diagnosed with clinical depression since she was thirteen stated. “On twitter or Tumblr or even Instagram, people will post pictures of themselves cutting in a group or write a very sad caption and others will comment about how much they love them. I think their struggles are definitely valid but I doubt that they are all clinically depressed.”

Similar to how parents sometimes diagnose their children with WebMD, teens have also started to diagnose themselves with mental illnesses based on symptoms that they experience and read about instead of going to a proper medical facility to get themselves checked. This often causes teens with no ill-will towards the mental health community to mistake their own teen angst for depression.

**Trivialising Mental Health**
Unlike cancer or other physical ailments, mental illness can only be physically detected using MRI scans. However, these scans are expensive and can be difficult for those with claustrophobia or radiation poisoning so they are not commonly conducted. Unfortunately, that lack of on-paper evidence can cause many to doubt the exitance and severity of mental illnesses, referring to it as ‘in your own head’. It certainly does not help when more and more teens start to claim that they may also have this illness without a doctor’s diagnosis.

“If everyone has depression, then its like well no one has it so what is the point.” Chanille Soh, 22, stated when asked about differentiating those with depression and teen angst. “But, then again, it is also very difficult to say if someone is pretending or just angsty, because depression is hard to spot. And, some people can’t go and get a diagnosis because of parents or finances.”
